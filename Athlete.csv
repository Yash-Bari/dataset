His father Ryota Horigome, a former street skateboarder, introduced his young son to the sport before he could walk.

Soon enough the board switched from toy to means of expression and Horigome began spending his days learning how to skate at the local “Amazing square” skate park in Tokyo.

Age 15, Horigome began entering skateboarding contests in America, drawing widespread attention for his ability to take on massive rails and gaps. Sensing California was the place to be to progress his career, in 2016 Horigome moved Stateside full-time.

His name lit up in lights when he became the first Japanese athlete to win a Street League Skateboarding event in May 2018. Demonstrating that it was by no means a fluke, the Tokyo-born skater followed his London title by going on to win a further two events later in the same year.

In 2019 things only got better for Horigome. He won two Olympic qualifying events and finished runner-up in the World Championships behind three-time defending champion and world number one, America Nyjah Huston.

Born in 2008, the 15-year-old Leal rose to prominence in a way only the youngest generation really know how – through the medium of viral video. A short video clip of Leal perfectly executing a heelflip down a set of stairs while donning a bright blue tutu as part of a fairy princess costume perfect exploded across social media platforms, propelling the then-7-year-old to internet notoriety.

Behind the tricks and clicks there is also a seriously talented competitor.

At 11 the goofy-footed skateboarder became the youngest street skater ever to win a Women’s Final on the Street League Skateboarding World Tour in Los Angeles. She bested current world number one Pamela Rosa to clinch the title. The Brazilian – who has been skating for eight years - featured twice at the X-Games in 2019, finishing fourth in both competitions.

Her Olympic journey began, aged 15, with a surprise 800m free gold medal at London 2012. She went on to win four golds at the 2014 Worlds.

Going into the Rio 2016 Games expectations were high, and Ledecky didn’t disappoint. She bagged the 200m, 400m, 800m and 4x200m freestyle titles to finish as the second most-decorated athlete at Rio 2016 after Michael Phelps.

In Tokyo, she edged her closest rival Ariarne Titmus to land another 800m Olympic gold medal, before winning the inaugural women's 1500m freestyle title.

The Hungarian chose to focus on the butterfly, and that decision paid dividends at the 2019 World Championships in Gwangju, where he clocked 1:50:73 over 200m to smash Michael Phelps' 10-year-old world record and win the world title.

The 2020 European Championships brought more success, with the Budapest native winning the 100m and 200m butterfly races, with a new national record of 50:18 in the former.

Milak became a national hero at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 (in 2021) when he blasted to a two-second victory in the 200m butterfly title to complete his medal collection. In the 100m fly, he broke Caeleb Dressel's Olympic record in the prelims, but eventually finished with the silver medal, behind the American, in the final.

Budapest was chosen as a late replacement host for the 2022 World Championships, and there was plenty to cheer about for the home fans as Milak lowered his own world record to win the 200m butterfly, before winning his first 100m butterfly title in Dressel's absence.",https://img.olympicchannel.com/images/image/private/t_1-1_300/f_auto/v1552235080/primary/jux5g5vrxv5fnglq93yj,Tokyo 2020,Gold

In the run up to the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020, the Queenslander clocked a 57.45 to break the 100m backstroke world record.

She then backed up that performance at the Games, winning two individual gold medals in the 100m and 200m backstroke, and another gold as part of the all-star Australian women's 4x100m medley team that also featured Chelsea Hodges, Emma McKeon, and Cate Campbell.

McKeown is also a highly versatile athlete. In the run up to Tokyo 2020, she won the 200m individual medley at the Australian National Championships, but withdrew from the event in order to focus on the backstroke sprints.

However, she did enter into the event instead of the 100m backstroke at the 2022 World Championships, and landed the 200m IM silver with an impressive 2:08:57. Elsewhere at the event, the 2001-born star completed her medal collection with 200m backstroke gold.

The Florida-born 23-year-old, like Phelps, can swim freestyle, breaststroke and butterfly to the highest of standards – a versatility that means he can potentially threaten in seven or more races this summer.

Dressel proved this at the 2017 World Aquatics Championships in Budapest, Hungary, where he swept the board and grabbed seven gold medals. Looking utterly dominant, he won the 50m freestyle, 100m freestyle, 100m butterfly, 4x100m freestyle, 4x100m medley, 4x100m mixed freestyle and the 4x100m mixed medley. He became the first man ever to get three golds in one night at that meeting.

And in 2019 he got six golds: 50m freestyle, 100m freestyle, 50m butterfly, 100m 50m butterfly and the 4x100m freestyle. In the 100m butterfly at that meeting, he broke the world record for the 100m butterfly; he also has the 50m freestyle world record.

Neeraj Chopra’s gold medal at Tokyo 2020 was also India’s second individual Olympic gold medal after shooter Abhinav Bindra’s 10m air rifle glory at Beijing 2008.

Heading into the Tokyo Olympics, Neeraj Chopra was, at best, a dark horse in the men’s javelin competition which featured a strong field consisting of overwhelming favourite Johannes Vetter, reigning world champion Anderson Peters, London 2012 gold medallist Keshorn Walcott, among others.

Come the main event, though, the Indian stepped up in a major way. Neeraj Chopra topped the qualifying round with an 86.65m throw, finishing above Vetter’s 85.64m.

But few, even among the most avid track and field followers, would have expected his rise to culminate in him breaking the world record so quickly.

Born to an American pole vaulter father and Swedish long jumper mother, Duplantis opted to compete internationally for his mother's home country. In 2015, still four months shy of his 16th birthday, he won the world under-18 title; barely two years later he had already broken the under-20 world record with a clearance of 5.90m, attracting the attention of the great Sergey Bubka. 

But it was another man, Renaud Lavillenie, who was Duplantis' idol growing up after they first met in 2013. ""I loved the way he pole vaulted. I kind of always wanted to jump like him,"" Duplantis said in 2017. That winter, he went to Clermont-Ferrand to train with the French Olympic champion for a few days.

The titles continued to follow, including European Championships gold in 2018. At that event, he cleared 6.05 metres – good enough to rank him as the fifth-best vaulter of all time. Duplantis chose to attend the Louisiana State University, but gave college up after a year to focus on his burgeoning professional athletics career. A year later at the 2019 Worlds in Doha, the Swede ended up with silver after a battle against American Sam Kendricks. But nothing quite prepared Duplantis' rivals or the world for what was to follow in early 2020.

Like Roger Bannister breaking the four minute mile in 1954, the Kenyan achieved something that many people believed physically couldn’t be done.

Some will argue about the details, but the facts remain remarkable. Kipchoge ran 26.2 miles in the time of 1:59:40, on a special course in Vienna, Austria. It did not count as an official marathon world record, because standard competition rules for pacing and fluids were not followed, and it wasn’t an ‘open’ race. He was paced by a car and carefully co-ordinated team of elite runners throughout.

But the moment still transcended the rules: the sense of occasion and Kipchoge’s emotions afterwards ensured that the completion of the 1:59 challenge, which he had already attempted and failed once, will be seen as his crowning achievement for years to come.

Kipchoge realised the significance immediately afterwards. “After Roger Bannister in 1954, it took another 63 years, I tried and I did not get it,” he said about the breakthrough. “I want to inspire many people, that no human is limited.”
