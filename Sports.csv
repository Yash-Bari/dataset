3X3 BASKETBALL,"What is 3x3 basketball?
3x3 basketball is an exciting, urban and innovative variation of basketball played with three players on each team on a half-court setup with one hoop and backboard. It is widely held to be the world’s number one urban team sport.

By whom, where and when was 3x3 basketball invented?
3x3 basketball was developed as a creative variation of traditional full-court basketball.

The sport has its origins in the urban areas of the United States of America in the late 1980s where the condensed form of basketball was often practiced in backyards and parks before eventually evolving into a cultural phenomenon.",https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.7wkwrj2cE8dm0DwSFHL9HwHaFj?pid=ImgDet&w=207&h=155&c=7&dpr=1.3
ACROBATIC GYMNASTICS,"Acrobatic gymnastics has existed in various forms and throughout different cultures for thousands of years. Depictions of acrobatics have been discovered in Bronze Age art, along with being mentioned in Homer’s epics and included in Ancient Greek symposiums and China’s Han Dynasty harvest festivals. It also served as entertainment for European courts during the Middle Ages.

Becoming a Discipline
Acrobatic gymnastics began to develop as a discipline through use of apparatus and through tumbling. Both aspects showcased the human body’s capabilities. The first competition rules for acrobatics were formed in the Soviet Union, where stadiums filled with spectators hoping to witness athletic feats, like forming giant human pyramids. The inaugural Soviet national championships were held in 1939.

Global Evolution
The first international tournament for what was then named “Sport Acrobatics” was held in Warsaw in 1957, with four participating teams. The International Federation of Sports Acrobatics (IFSA) was established in 1973, with the first world championships held the following year in Moscow, featuring teams from Bulgaria, Federal Republic of Germany, Great Britain, Hungary, Poland, the Soviet Union and the United States. In 1998, the discipline was adopted by the International Gymnastics Federation once IFSA dissolved. The discipline has been known as Acrobatic Gymnastics since 2007.

ALPINE SKIING,"Alpine Skiing
Skiing has an ancient history. The birth of modern downhill skiing is often dated to the 1850s, when Norwegian legend Sondre Norheim popularised skis with curved sides, bindings with stiff heel bands made of willow, as well as the Telemark and Christiania (slalom) turns.

Ancient Origins
Skiing can be traced to prehistoric times by the discovery of varying sizes and shapes of wooden planks preserved in peat bogs in Russia, Finland, Sweden and Norway. Ski fragments discovered in Russia have been carbon-dated back to circa 8000-7000 BC. It is virtually certain that a form of skiing has been an integral part of life in colder countries for thousands of years.

First Competitions
Skiing changed from a method of transportation into a sporting activity during the late 19th century. The first non-military skiing competitions are reported to have been held in the 1840s in northern and central Norway. The first national skiing competition in Norway, held in the capital Christiania (now Oslo) and won by Sondre Norheim, in 1868, is regarded as the beginning of a new era of skiing enthusiasm. A few decades later, the sport spread to the remainder of Europe and to the U.S., where miners held skiing competitions to entertain themselves during the winter. The first slalom competition was organised by Sir Arnold Lunn in 1922 in Mürren, Switzerland.",https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.eu6U1YsUTG8NHMZM5bIFVAHaEo?w=277&h=180&c=7&r=0&o=5&dpr=1.3&pid=1.7
ARCHERY,"What is archery?
Archery is one of the oldest sports still practised, and is closely linked to the development of civilisation. Using bows and arrows, the sport as a history dating back thousands of years. As a cultural advance, it was comparable to the discovery of fire and the invention of the wheel.

By whom, where and when was archery invented?
Archery was the favourite sport of the Egyptian pharaohs during the 18th dynasty (1567-1320 BC). Many centuries later, some of the earliest recorded archery tournaments took place during the Zhou dynasty (1046 - 256 BC) in China. Such events were attended by Chinese nobility. Much later, English writers honoured the longbow for famous contributions to their country’s victories in the battles of Crécy, Agincourt and Poitiers.

In 1200 BC, the Hittites and Assyrians shot their bows from chariots, becoming fearsome opponents in battle. They made their bows with tendon, horn and wood, and also developed a new re-curved shape. This made their bows shorter and more powerful, making them easier to handle for an archer on horseback.",https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.oV9t6d53MWnzBMfWh5klAwHaE8?pid=ImgDet&w=189&h=126&c=7&dpr=1.3
ARTISTIC GYMNASTICS,"What is Artistic Gymnastics?
Introduced in 1894, artistic gymnastics was one of the original disciplines in the modern Olympic Games. Artistic gymnasts are challenged to perfect their skills across a range of equipment, such as the beam and performing on the floor.

By whom, where and when was Artistic Gymnastics invented?
Plato, Aristotle, and Homer heartily advocated the strengthening qualities of gymnastic activity. The Ancient Greek civilisation more than two thousand years ago believed symmetry between the mind and body was possible only when physical exercise was coupled with intellectual activity.

The term ""artistic gymnastics"" emerged in the early 1800s to distinguish free-flowing styles from techniques used in military training. Gymnastic competitions began to flourish in schools and athletic clubs across Europe, and made a fitting return at the first edition of the modern Olympic Games were revived in Athens in 1896.

ARTISTIC SWIMMING,"What is Artistic Swimming?
Artistic swimming, formerly known as synchronised swimming, is a relatively new discipline with its origins in water acrobatics.

By whom, where and when was Artistic Swimming invented?
Originally known as water ballet, the pastime was first practised in the late 19th century with the first recorded competition held in the German capital Berlin in 1891.

At the start of the 20th century, Australian swimmer Annette Kellerman helped popularise the sport when she toured the United States performing water acrobatics.

ATHLETICS,"What is Athletics?
Athletics is a sport that includes a number of events involving running, jumping, throwing or walking. Often referred to as track & field, the sport includes single events, such as the 100m, marathon or long jump, combined events, including the decathlon and heptathlon, or team-based events such as the 4x100m relays.

By whom, where and when was athletics invented?
While athletics has been practised throughout history, the first ever event contested at the ancient Olympic Games was the “stadium” race, a sprint of about 192 metres. Winners in this event have been recorded from as far back as 776 BC.

Athletics and the Olympics
The ancient Olympic Games included a number of athletics events that sports fans today would recognise including running, long jump, shot put and javelin. By the time of the first modern Olympic Games at Athens 1896, athletics was once again one of the main features of the programme, with track events ranging from 100m to 1500m, the marathon, and field events such as long jump and pole vault. At Tokyo 2020, athletes competed in 26 events - the same number that is on the programme for Paris 2024.",https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.dQKWGbN9kfWPg1uAj9gI-QHaEK?w=265&h=180&c=7&r=0&o=5&dpr=1.3&pid=1.7
BADMINTON,"What is Badminton?
Badminton is a racket-and-shuttle game played on a court by two players or doubles teams. The sport takes its name from Badminton House—home of the Duke of Beaufort in the English county of Gloucestershire.

By whom, where and when was Badminton invented?
In 1873, the Duke is credited with bringing a version of the game—Poona—back from India and introducing it to his guests.

The sport quickly grew in popularity, and in 1877, the first set of written rules were devised by the newly formed Bath Badminton Club. The Badminton Federation of England was created 16 years later, and in 1899, it organised the first All England Championships.

BASEBALL SOFTBALL,"What is Baseball/Softball?
Baseball and softball are two related ball sports played between two teams on a diamond-shaped field.

What's the difference between Baseball and Softball?
While there are world championships for both men and women in both sports, at the Olympic level baseball has been a men's-only sport while softball has been a women's-only sport. There are differences in the number of players on each team between the two sports, the size of the field, and in some rules.

Softball pitchers are also required to throw underhand, and most pitchers throw using the windmill pitch style, where the ball is thrown after rotating in a large circle. In softball, top female pitchers can reach speeds of over 100km/h. That speed fits with the fast-paced nature of the game. Since the bases aren’t as far apart, there is a shorter pitching distance. The game is also shorter in duration to baseball, with only seven innings compared to baseball’s nine.",https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.sFKwzdi5MucPNLIGTsRQYwHaNK?w=115&h=180&c=7&r=0&o=5&dpr=1.3&pid=1.7
BASKETBALL,"What is Basketball?
Basketball is a team sport played on a rectangular court where two opposing teams made up of five players attempt to score by throwing a ball into the opponent's hoop and net, otherwise known as a basket.

By whom, where and when was Basketball invented?
Basketball was invented in December 1891 by Canadian James W. Naismith, an instructor at the YMCA Training School in Massachusetts.

Naismith sought a suitable indoor game to keep his students fit and warm during the cold New England winters. He formulated 13 rules, most of which still apply today.",https://www.rxwallpaper.site/wp-content/uploads/cool-3d-wallpaper-hd-basketball-68-images.jpg
BEACH HANDBALL,"Beach Handball
After beach volleyball began to thrive on Italy’s beaches, it inspired the country’s handball players to transfer the game to the sand.

Beach Handball Evolution
In the late 1980s, Italian coach Simonetta Montagni began developing handball on the beach. As the discipline began to grow in popularity, coach Luciano Bartolini was asked to create the first set of rules for the game in 1990, making the fast-paced game fit within the existing beach volleyball court lines.

In 2000, beach handball became an official European Handball Federation (EHF) sport, and the first EHF Beach Handball European Championship was held that year in Gaeta, Italy. The sport was further developed with representatives of the International Handball Federation (IHF), and it began to reach a global audience. In 2004, the first Beach Handball World Championship was held in Egypt, and the first IHF under-17 World Championships were held in Mauritius in 2017. There, Spain won the men’s event and Hungary claimed the women’s gold.",https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.8SmUiuSc-Etm-jcfPoKOEAHaEJ?w=307&h=180&c=7&r=0&o=5&dpr=1.3&pid=1.7
BEACH VOLLEYBALL,"What is Beach Volleyball?
Olympic beach volleyball is a team sport played by two players on each side of a sand court divided by a net. The objective of the game is to hit the ball – with hands or arms only – over the net into the opponents’ court until the other side is unable to return the ball or the ball heads outside of the court lines. Each rally secures one point.

By whom, where and when was Beach Volleyball invented?
Beach volleyball is a variant of the indoor version, invented in 1895 by American gym teacher William G Morgan.

The first recorded game of beach volleyball was at the Outrigger Canoe Club on Waikiki Beach in Hawaii in 1915, when coach and club captain George Center set up a net on the sand and brought out a volleyball to entertain the club members on a day when there was no surf.",https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.ZsVOHRyaXzXermFxTiuj_QHaEK?w=320&h=180&c=7&r=0&o=5&dpr=1.3&pid=1.7
BIATHLON,"Biathlon combines the power and aggression of cross-country skiing with the precision and calm of marksmanship.

Roots in Survival
The word ""biathlon"" stems from the Greek word for two contests, and is today seen as the joining of two sports: skiing and shooting. Biathlon has its roots in survival skills practised in the snow-covered forests of Scandinavia, where people hunted on skis with rifles slung over their shoulders.

Standardising the Rules
In 1948, the Union Internationale de Pentathlon Moderne et Biathlon (UIPMB) was founded to standardise the rules for biathlon and pentathlon. In 1993, the biathlon branch of the UIPMB created the International Biathlon Union (IBU), which officially separated from the UIPMB in 1998.",https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.P2k7EzGCiuXXzfVKDqI7bAHaEo?w=296&h=184&c=7&r=0&o=5&dpr=1.3&pid=1.7
BOBSLEIGH,"Bobsleigh is a winter sport invented by the Swiss in the late 1860s, in which teams make timed runs down narrow, twisting, banked, iced tracks in a gravity-powered sled.

19th Century Beginnings
The sport of bobsleigh didn't begin until the late 19th century, when the Swiss attached two skeleton sleds together and added a steering mechanism to make a toboggan. A chassis was added to give protection to wealthy tourists, and the world's first bobsleigh club was founded in St. Moritz, Switzerland in 1897.

Super Heavy
By the 1950s, the critical importance of the start had been recognized, and athletes with explosive strength from other sports were drawn to bobsledding. In 1952, a critical rule change limiting the total weight of crew and sled ended the era of the super-heavyweight bobsledder and rebalanced the sport as an athletic contest.",https://images8.alphacoders.com/442/442515.jpg
BOXING,"What is Boxing?
Boxing is a form of hand-to-hand unarmed combat where one athlete attempts to land punches on the head or body (above waist-height) of the opponent to score points - as decided by judges - or render said opponent unable to continue.

By whom, where and when was Boxing invented?
While the earliest evidence of boxing dates back to Ancient Egypt in around 3000 BC, it was not until the 16th century that 'prizefighting' or bare-knuckle boxing began to spring up, largely in Great Britain.

In 1867, the Marquess of Queensberry rules were published which codified boxing for the first time and mandated the use of boxing gloves.",https://wallpaperaccess.com/full/2302343.jpg
BREAKING,"What is Breaking?
From the streets of New York to the biggest stage in sports: breaking (also known as breakdancing) is an urban dance style that originated in the Bronx borough of New York in the 1970s. It is a form of dance sport that blends urban dance with remarkable athleticism. It emerges from hip hop culture and is characterised by acrobatic movements,

By whom, where and when was Breaking invented?
The earliest proponents of breaking were Black and Puerto Rican youths who formed crews who would compete in dance battles on the streets. Breaking athletes are referred to as “B-Boys”, “B-Girls'' or “breakers”, the “b” standing for break, since athletes put down dance moves during instrumental breaks in a song.

Since its start on the streets, breaking has developed and gained a global following as an art form, intertwining elements of music, dance and athleticism. Within the Olympic movement, breaking is a discipline of the World DanceSport Federation (WDSF) that was founded in 1957. The first WDSF World DanceSport Games were held in 2013 in Chinese Taipei.

CROSS-COUNTRY SKIING,"Cross-country skiing is the oldest type of skiing. It emerged from a need to travel over snow-covered terrain and developed as a sport at the end of the 19th century.

Norwegian Origins
For centuries in the snow-covered North, skis were required to chase game and gather firewood in winter time. With long distances between the small, isolated communities and hard, snowy winters, skiing also became important as means of keeping in social contact. The word “ski” is a Norwegian word which comes from the Old Norse word “skid”, a split length of wood.

Earliest Form
Different types of skis emerged at various regions at about the same time. One type had a horizontal toe-piece binding. The modern ski bindings are based on the Fennoscandian model of the 19th century. The East-Siberian type was a thin board with a vertical four-hole binding. Sometimes it was covered with fur. The Lapps used a horizontal stem-hole binding. Present-day cross-country skis were developed from the type used by the Lapps.

CURLING,"Curling is a team sport played by two teams of four players on a rectangular sheet of ice. Its nickname, ""the roaring game"", originates from the rumbling sound the 44-pound (19.96kg) granite stones make when they travel across the ice.

Broom or Brush
There are two types of broom. The most common is a brush or ""push broom"". The other is a corn/straw/Canadian broom, which, with long bristles, looks much like a normal broom.

Ice
For indoor tournaments, the artificially created ice has its surface sprinkled with water droplets, which freeze into tiny bumps on the surface. Called ""pebbled ice"", this surface helps the stone's grip and leads to more consistent curling.",https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.1TGw7ciHnYYXF6Z0hrtqsQHaE6?w=261&h=180&c=7&r=0&o=5&dpr=1.3&pid=1.7

CYCLING MOUNTAIN BIKE,"What is Mountain Bike Cycling?
As its name suggests, mountain bike cycling involves cycling off-road on mountainous or very hilly terrain using a specialised bicycle.

By whom, where and when was Mountain Bike Cycling invented?
In the 1970s, mountain biking developed as a fringe sport in California. Taking a bike off-road was nothing new, but the development of a new bike that relished such terrain was; these bikes had fatter tyres, rapid-shift gears, drum brakes and ground-breaking suspension. These bikes gave thrill-seeking cyclists much more freedom, and the sport of mountain biking was born.

The members of the Velo Club Mount Tamalpais in California generally receive the credit for establishing mountain biking as a sport. They invented the Repack Downhill race, held regularly between 1976 and 1979 just across the famous Golden Gate Bridge from San Francisco. The races attracted riders from near and far, and the media soon started taking an interest.

Figure skating, as its name suggests, involves skating ""figures"" on ice. The sport requires competitors to skate selected patterns, or figures, as part of their routines. Ice skating has developed from a practical way to get around on ice into the elegant mix of art and sport it is today.

By whom, where and when was figure skating invented? 
The Dutch were arguably the earliest pioneers of skating. They began using canals to maintain communication by skating from village to village as far back as the 13th century. Skating eventually spread across the channel to England, and soon the first clubs and artificial rinks began to form. Passionate skaters included several kings of England, Marie Antoinette, Napoleon III and German writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.

Two Americans are responsible for the major developments in the history of the sport. In 1850, Edward Bushnell of Philadelphia revolutionised skating when he introduced steel-bladed skates allowing complex manoeuvres and turns. Jackson Haines, a ballet master living in Vienna in the 1860s, added elements of ballet and dance to give the sport its grace.

FREESTYLE SKIING,"Freestyle skiing combines speed, showmanship and the ability to perform aerial manoeuvres whilst skiing.

‘Hotdogging’
There are records of people performing somersaults on skis at the beginning of the 20th century in Norway, Italy and Austria, and in the early 1920s, U.S. skiers started to flip and spin. Freestyle skiing really began to take off in America during the 1960s, when social change and freedom of expression together with the advances in ski equipment led to the development of new and exciting skiing techniques. Freestyle skiing was affectionately known as ‘hotdogging’. The name seemed to perfectly capture the breathtaking mix of acrobatic tricks, jumps and sheer adrenalin rush of the sport.

Getting Recognition
Freestyle was recognised as a discipline by the International Ski Federation (FIS) in 1979. The governing body brought in new regulations in an effort to curb some of the more dangerous elements of the infant sport, and the first FIS World Cup series was staged the following year.

Football Roots
Futsal is a five-a-side format of football, and the only form of indoor football approved by world governing body FIFA. Futsal emphasises technique, creativity, improvisation and ball control.

South American Origins
Futsal’s origins can be traced to South America, where Argentine-born coach Juan Carlos Ceriani devised a variation of the traditional 11-a-side football game for indoor competitions in YMCAs in Montevideo, Uruguay. Meanwhile, in São Paulo, Brazil, a game was also developing on the streets. Futsal soon spread through the continent. Participation continues to grow, and FIFA estimates more than 30 million play futsal globally.

Handball was first played towards the end of the 19th century in Scandinavia and Germany. 'Field handball' - an 11-a-side game played outdoors - was first recognised at the turn of the century, and G. Wallström introduced indoor handball to Sweden in 1910.

Between 1938 and 1966, both forms of handball were played at separate World Championships with indoor handball gaining pre-eminence.

HOCKEY,"What is Field Hockey?
There are two types of hockey – field and ice. Field hockey, played at the Olympic Summer Games, takes place on an artificial-grass pitch where two teams of 11 – 10 infield players and one goalkeeper – compete against each other to score the most goals in the opposing side’s net. Players use a stick with a rounded end to hit a hard ball, slightly larger than a tennis ball.

By whom, where and when was Hockey invented?

A form of hockey has been played in various guises for thousands of years – in Egypt (4,000 years ago), Ethiopia (1,000 BC), and Iran (2,000 BC). The Romans and Greeks, as well as the Aztecs, also played a version of the game but the modern game emerged in England in the mid-19th century.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/lancasteronline.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/6f/86f777f6-4ee1-11e6-ab5f-4f68ad2f9ba0/579023ba0b09c.image.jpg?resize=990%2C639
ICE HOCKEY,"What is ice hockey?
Ice hockey is a fast, fluid and exciting team sport featuring two teams of six players (a goaltender and five skaters) on ice. It draws big crowds at the Olympic Games thanks to the drama and tension of the matches.

By whom, where and when was ice hockey invented?
Ice hockey originated in Canada in the early 19th century, based on several similar sports played in Europe, although the word “hockey” comes from the old French word “hocquet”, meaning “stick”. Around 1860, a puck was substituted for a ball, and in 1879, two McGill University students, Robertson and Smith, devised the first rules.

The first recognised team, the McGill University Hockey Club, was formed in 1880 as hockey became the Canadian national sport and spread throughout the country. In 1892, the Governor General of Canada donated the Stanley Cup, which was first won by a team representing the Montreal Amateur Athletic Association.

NORDIC COMBINED,"This sport, which has a long Olympic history, combines ski jumping and cross-country skiing.

Norwegian Origins
For centuries in the snow-covered North, skis were required to chase game and gather firewood in winter time. With long distances between the small, isolated communities, and hard, snowy winters, skiing also became important as means of keeping in social contact. The word “ski” is a Norwegian word which comes from the Old Norse word “skid”, a split length of wood.

Holmenkollen Ski Festival
The famous Holmenkollen ski festival started in 1892, where the main attraction was the Nordic combined event. The festival proved popular and soon attracted skiers from Sweden and other neighbouring countries. In fact, King Olav V of Norway was himself an able jumper and competed in the Holmenkollen Ski Festival in the 1920s.

ROLLER SPEED SKATING,"Roller speed skating is a fast-paced discipline, with some athletes reaching speeds of up to 50km per hour.

The Basics
Roller speed skating events are usually held on outdoor — and occasionally indoor — rinks with banked walls or on closed road circuits. A maximum of five wheels are allowed on the inline skates athletes wear, and wheels cannot exceed diameters of 110mm. For marathons only, skates can have 125mm diameter wheels. No brakes are allowed. The constant jostling for a favourable position combined with the mass start, velodrome-like walls and 200m track make for thrilling competitions often decided by photo finishes.

 Official
The first Roller Speed Skating World Championship was held in Monza, Italy, in 1937. The following year, London hosted the 1938 Track Roller Speed Skating World Championship. At the Olympic Summer Games Barcelona 1992, rink hockey, played on quad skates, was a demonstration sport.

SHORT TRACK SPEED SKATING,"Short Track Speed Skating
In short track speed skating, athletes compete not against the clock, but against each other. This introduces the elements of strategy, bravery and skill needed for racing.

North American Origin
Short track (or indoor) speed skating began in Canada and the United States of America, where they held mass-start competitions on an oval track as early as 1905-1906. The lack of 400m long tracks led many North American skaters to practice on ice rinks. However, practicing on a smaller track brought new challenges, like tighter turns and shorter straightaways, which lead to different techniques in order to win on a shorter track. These countries began competing against each other on an annual basis. The sport’s rise in popularity was partly thanks to the North American racing rules, which introduced a “pack” style of racing. Capitalising on this, the organisers of the 1932 Lake Placid Games, with the consent of the International Skating Union (ISU), agreed to follow these rules for the programme’s speed skating events.

International Recognition
Countries such as Great Britain, Australia, Belgium, France and Japan deserve a great deal of credit in the development of the sport, since they participated in international open competitions before the sport was recognized by the International Skating Union. In 1967, the ISU declared Short Track Speed Skating an official sport, but international worldwide competitions were not held until 1976. During this period of time, countries kept competing amongst themselves.",https://assets-cms.thescore.com/uploads/image/file/30831/w768xh576_REU_1877782.jpg

SKELETON,"Skeleton racing involves plummeting head-first down a steep and treacherous ice track on a tiny sled. It is considered the world's first sliding sport.

Thrill-seeking Tourists
Sleighing is one of the oldest winter sports. Descriptions of the sport can be found in 16th-century literature, but as a racing sport, it can be traced to the mid-19th century, when British tourists started sliding down snowbound roads in the Alps. British and American holidaymakers built the first toboggan run in Davos in 1882.

The Cresta Run
Skeleton sled racing owes it entire early history to St. Moritz and the famed Cresta Run. The sport developed in the Swiss resort town as a pursuit for the rich. E. F. Benson put it best when he wrote in 1913, “There is one Mecca, there is one St. Peter's, and there is one Cresta.”

SKI JUMPING","Over the past hundred years, ski jumping has evolved enormously, with different jumping techniques allowing jumpers to achieve even greater distances.

Beginnings in Norway
The origin of ski jumping can be traced to Ole Rye, who jumped 9.5m in 1808. Norwegian Sondre Norheim is widely considered the father of modern ski jumping. In 1866, he won what has been described as the world’s first ski jumping competition with prizes, held at Ofte, Høydalsmo, Norway.

Early Pioneers
After World War I, Thulin Thams and Sigmund Ruud developed a new jumping style known as the Kongsberger Technique. This involved jumping with the upper body bent at the hips, a wide forward lean, and with arms extended at the front with the skis parallel to each other. Using this technique, Sepp Bradl of Austria became the first to jump more than 100 metres when he jumped 101 metres in 1936.

SKI MOUNTAINEERING,"In ski mountaineering, often referred to as “skimo”, competitors ski uphill and downhill and use mountaineering abilities to race through snow-covered mountains.

Roots of Ski Mountaineering
Skiing can be traced to prehistoric times, due to man’s necessity to move over hilly and mountainous terrain in an effective way during the snowy winter months. Archaeologists have discovered images that depict figures moving across snow on what appear to be wooden skis, and paintings from the Middle Ages indicate the use of “skins” for snow covered ascents. Furthermore, wooden planks of varying sizes and shapes have been discovered preserved in peat bogs in Russia, Finland, Sweden and Norway. Ski mountaineering originated in Europe, with German Wilhelm Paulcke’s 1897 completion of the first alpine traverse — crossing the Bernese Oberland on skis — considered to be the start of modern ski mountaineering. Originally, there were animal skins, which at the beginning of the twentieth century became only seal skins and nowadays are synthetic.

Going Global
The discipline is growing in popularity across the world in recent years, counting international events taking place in many countries, such as Switzerland, France, Italy, North America, South America, Russia, Scandinavia, China, South Korea and Japan. The first World Championships for ski mountaineering were held in 2002 in France and now this kind of international event is organised every two years alternatively with the Continental Championships. Furthermore, a World Cup circuit is set up every year with a minimum of five stages. Starting from the 2020-2021 season, and for the years to come, a World Championship Long Distance and a Masters World Championship will be organised. There are currently 38 member national federations of the International Ski Mountaineering Federation (ISMF) belonging to three different continents (Europe, Asia and America).The ski mountaineering discipline attracts athletes from a range of backgrounds, including cyclists, swimmers, runners, hikers and mountaineers.

SNOWBOARD,"Snowboarding combines elements of surfing, skateboarding and skiing.

Recent History
Snowboarding was developed in the United States in the 1960s as people across the country began to seek out new winter activities. Over the next decade, various pioneers boosted the production of boards, and the sport began to gain crossover appeal. Surfers and skateboarders became involved, and by 1980, snowboarding was a nationwide activity.

Mountain Conflict
In the late 1970s, snowboarders started to “invade” traditional ski resorts, but faced opposition from skiers who tried to exclude the snowboarders from “their” mountains. By the 1990s, however, almost all ski resorts had accepted snowboarding, and the resorts have found the snowboarders to be an excellent source of new revenue.

The first modern trampoline was built by George Nissen and Larry Griswold around 1934 at the University of Iowa. It was initially used to train tumblers and astronauts, and as a training tool to develop and hone acrobatic skills for other sports such as diving, gymnastics and freestyle skiing. People enjoyed the sensation so much, they began to trampoline for sheer fun, and it became popular in its own right.

Nissen and Griswold envisaged trampolines being used in a variety of new games, although they never grabbed the public’s imagination. In one, called Spaceball, two teams of two on a single trampoline with specially constructed end walls attempted to propel a ball through a middle wall, to hit a target on the other side’s end wall.
